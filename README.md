# CoursPresso
This is a course comparison website.

We are aiming to tackle the problem of choosing courses from the many sources available on the internet. Abundance of choices often causes confusion and this confusion leads to inefficiency, especially while trying to learn.
By using our website, students will be able to compare the various courses available on different websites on the basis of interest, cost, and ratings.

We thought of this project in view of our own experiences and also by interacting with our peers. Most of our peers agreed that selecting the correct course that would help them is an extremely tedious task. Many mentioned instances of how they bought courses and then regretted taking those due to various reasons, the ultimate outcome being waste of money and time.

We aim to provide a convenient solution for these problems.
